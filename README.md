# CS-584-Final-Project

The main code for this poroject is called RNN-pretraining.py. The labeled Twitter data was too large to upload to GitHub, but it can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140

The labeled Twitter data needs to be downloaded in addition to the three .pkl files on this GitHub repository. After this, the code can be run after changing the pathway to load in the data in the code. 

The final report is the .pdf file in this repository.
